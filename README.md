# Project MRI Segmentation

Contexte
=========================

Discogenic low back pain, named discogenic lombalgia, is a major public health concern that is
frequently associated with lumbar intervertebral disc degenerative disease (DDD). Numerous tools
and animal models have been used to help us improve our understanding of the DDD physiopathology
and develop imaging methods to detect it as early as possible. The sheep has been shown to be a
valuable large animal model thanks to the similarities (gross anatomy, mechanical properties) of its
lumbar intervertebral disc (IVD) with those of human lumbar IVD. In parallel, quantitative magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) seems to be a clinically-relevant tool to explore early DDD, in particular
T2* relaxation time measurements. During preliminary study, we compared three MRI methods of
quantitative time measurements evaluation of lumbar ovine IVD (T1, T2 and T2*) using different
manually drawn region-of-interest (ROI). Interestingly, while T2 and T2* mapping are well described
to characterize the DDD in various species, our preliminary data strongly suggest that T1 mapping
using the variable flip-angle could be a promising tool to specifically assess the early events of
DDD in an ovine model and maybe in human patient.

Regarding the time-consuming analysis of data and opportunity offered with the deep learning approach, the objective of this project is to develop an automated-analysis program of MRI images based on sheep image database acquired during manually-preliminary study. In particular, the developed methods will contribute to the segmentation of the disc within the database.
